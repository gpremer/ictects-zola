                        I'm a freelance, full stack software consultant. ICTects
                        BV is my corporation. My areas of expertise are centered
                        around functional programming in Scala & Typescript.

                    <p>
                        I love designing and implementing solutions that are
                        robust and flexible enough to withstand the unforeseen
                        challenges that always crop up when an application is
                        released to production.

                        DevOps, CI, monitoring & deployment to cloud providers

                        Lastly, I enjoy learning new stuff and spreading the

                            As a software solutions specialist, my primary focus
                            is on helping organizations implement effective
                            solutions. This includes collaborating on the design
                            of a solution, writing the necessary software,
                            configuring the infrastructure, and ensuring
                            successful deployment and follow-up. By taking a
                            holistic approach, I am able to ensure that the
                            implemented solution is tailored to the
                            organization's specific needs and will continue to
                            meet those needs over time.

                        Enough with all the fluff, let's give a somewhat
                        chronological overview of what my computer-related
                        interests have been over the years.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The beginning</h2>
                    <p>
                        <div class="inline-image c64"></div>
                        It al began in 1983 when I got a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey_2">Phillips
                            Videopac G7000</a>. Altough I spent most of my time
                        playing games on it, I also had a cartridge that let me
                        make my first programs. In assembly language, no less.
                        The programs where limited to 99 instructions but I
                        learned about binary and hexadecimal numbers, boolean
                        logic and control flow. The seed was planted!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few years later, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore
                            64</a> entered our home. And with it came Commodore
                        Basic: <span class="code">GOTO</span>, <span class="code">peek</span> and <span
                            class="code">poke</span>. Structured programming also
                        revealed itself to me in the guise of Pascal; with a
                        compiler and linker on two different floppies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1987 modernity took hold in the form of a PC clone,
                        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC1512">Amstrad
                            PC1512</a>. Turbo Pascal became my weapon of choice. And
                        I got used to keyboard macros in WordPerfect and
                        WordStar. I got familiar with Spreadsheet and database
                        programming with Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase III+
                        respectively.

                    <h2>The university years</h2>
                    <p>
                        <div class="inline-image cpp"></div>
                        Pure informatics seemed a bit dull to 18-year old me, so
                        as to keep a maximum of options open, I enrolled in the
                        Applied Sciences engineering degree at the University of
                        Ghent. Since a Computer Science masters wasn't offered
                        yet in 1991, I opted for Electronics. In my last masters
                        year, a CS degree was introduced. I took the jump and I
                        became the first CS Engineer to graduate at the
                        University of Ghent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since most of my formal education was about mathematics,
                        electromagnetism and electronics I continued my
                        tradition of self study and got immersed in Object
                        Oriented programming. First with Turbo Pascal and later
                        with Turbo C++.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After 5 years of studying, I didn't feel quite ready to
                        enter “the industry”, so I began working at the
                        university for 4 more years as a teaching assistant to
                        the late professor G. Hoffman. I helped with courses
                        such as “Programming II” (C & C++), “Analysis & design”
                        (UML) and, my favourite, “Formal Methods” (with prof. R.
                        Boute).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During those 4 years, the world of Linux opened itself
                        to me. As well, the <a
                            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020604011051/http://inprem.rug.ac.be/">Internet</a>
                        finally came to my desk at a whopping 2kBips!
                        Programming-wise, it was still mostly C++ and some Perl.
                        But in the later years, also Java made its debut.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Working as an employee</h2>
                    <p>
                        <div class="inline-image java"></div>
                        In 1998, <a href="https://inno.com">INNOCOM</a> was
                        founded as a collaboration of private capital and
                        leading Belgian universities and it's there and then
                        that I began my life as a technology consultant. I
                        worked at INNOCOM for 9 years and, being such a young
                        company, I wore several hats: architect, application
                        designer and implementer, technical team and practice
                        lead and responsible for internal IT. I got the
                        opportunity to work for many distinct customers. Both
                        SME's and industry- leading multinationals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technology-wise, it was mostly Java, Linux, Apache,
                        mySql and Perl but there was also a fair bit of work
                        related to the Microsoft platform with J++, ASP, COM+,
                        SqlServer and IIS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While working at Toyota, I also got to immerse myself in
                        mainframe technologies such as JCL, DB2 and SQLJ in
                        combination with the J2EE stack.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Self employed</h2>
                    <p>
                        <div class="inline-image scala"></div>
                        In 2007 I started my own one-man consultancy business.
                        At first, I continued the same line of work as at
                        Inno.com. However, my real passion passion is in
                        hands-on solving technical challenges, so I gradually
                        moved from architecture consultancy to application
                        design and implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not long after my switch to self employment, I
                        discovered Scala and functional programming. At first
                        more an intellectual pursuit, this evolved to my main
                        professional specialisation. My knowledge of functional
                        programming was then further deepened by using the
                        excellent fp-ts library with TypeScript.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During this period, I witnessed the rise of the cloud
                        and I got to “play” with the Amazon and Google cloud
                        offerings from their beginnings. Related technologies
                        breaking into the mainstream were Big Data and Machine
                        Learning. I gained experience with then working for Sony
                        and through self study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additional computer languages that I used along the way
                        were Bash, Elm, Groovy, Haskell, Nix, Octave, Python, R,
                        Ruby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the notable tooling and platforms were Akka,
